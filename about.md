I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from National University of Asuncion, RedHat Certified System Administrator and RedHat Certified Engineer. 
Experience in UNIX/LINUX infrastructure, backup software, virtualization, service
monitoring, AWS, GCP, Storage Area Network, and Storage arrays. Also, I have
experience in DevOps practices such as Infrastructure as Code with Terraform,
CI/CD with Gitlab , Observability with TIG stack for metrics and ELK stack for logs,
Automation using Ansible , Ansible Tower, and Python scripts. My experience with
containers is using Docker and Docker Swarm for orchestration. For project
planning, I use the Scrum framework. I like working in a trusting environment, I
am goal oriented and I consider myself a life long learner, always looking for opportunities to learn something new.
Also, I like to take a walk and work out.
Now, I am working at one of the largest Telco companies in Paraguay as a System Administrator, SRE and DevOps.
Iâ€™m married to Alicia and we have a wonderful child, his name is Mauricio.
