```bash
Apr 13 10:29:44 lb1 Keepalived_vrrp: VRRP_Instance(VI_1) ignoring received advertisment...
Apr 13 10:29:45 lb1 Keepalived_vrrp: receive an invalid passwd!
Apr 13 10:29:45 lb1 Keepalived_vrrp: bogus VRRP packet received on eth0 !!!
```

This problem is due another keepalived configuration, hence is sending its VRRP message in the same virtual_router_id. Capturing vrrp packets with tcpdump youâ€™ll see how another machine is sending messages to your configuration and filling the logs with the shown above. To solve this issue you must reset the virtual_router_id to another one.
